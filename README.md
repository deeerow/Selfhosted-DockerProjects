### Selfhosted-DockerProjects


Should have a logrotate just in case if your logs get to full and unable to write to your docker logs anymore, so it is good practice to have a automatic log rotator cron job, that way you don't need to worry about logs getting to big or filling up your drive space.
```
# place this example code at /etc/logrotate.d/(logname) on your docker host server
# please adjust the custom file path below, where your logs are stored
# please adjust the below traefik container name to send the USR1 signal for log rotation

/var/log/crowdsec/*.log {
  su root root
  size 20M
  daily
  rotate 14
  compress
  missingok
  notifempty
  postrotate
    dateext
    dateformat .%Y-%m-%d
    create 0666 root root   # the reason why we want 666 is because authelia.log requires write access unfortunately otherwise 0644 is ideal
    docker kill --signal="USR1" traefik   # adjust this line to your traefik container name
  endscript
}
